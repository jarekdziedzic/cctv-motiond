TODO: The inputs should be list of images of arbitrary length greater than 2, and maximum sensitivity
TODO: Outputs could be status and setting file attributes (attr -s) indicating how much motion there is 
TODO: There could be a web app which has a slider for sensitivity and dynamically changes the images
TODO: presented to the viewer. Lots wind - low sensitivity. Not much movement, high sensitivity.
The benefit of all this is that I don't need to maintain separate database(s)
